This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
require(ggrain)
```


## Data Load


```{r}
plantdf <- read.csv("/home/RHHLab/Research/Others/BayazidSir/plantDataT.csv")
percentdf <- read.csv("/home/RHHLab/Research/Others/BayazidSir/PercentContent.csv")
nutrientdf <- read.csv("/home/RHHLab/Research/Others/BayazidSir/NutrientContent.csv")
majordf <- read.csv("/home/RHHLab/Research/Others/BayazidSir/MajorNutrient.csv")
```

```{r}
plantdf
```

```{r}
ggplot(plantdf, aes(1, Height, fill = Treatment, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_rain(alpha = .6,
            boxplot.args = list(color = "black", outlier.shape = NA)) +
  theme_classic() +

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
